+ getAvailableFiles(): String
+ getFileContents(int fileID): String


Explanation: getAvailableFiles()
- This method will return String listing the files that the user can access. This will be run by the UserInterface object when no arguments are provided by the user. The method will ask the file handler for an array of files, convert the list into a string, then pass the string back to the user interface.
Returns:
    - A String listing all available files.

Explanation: getFileContents(int fileID)
- This method will return the contents of a specified file. It takes an integer fileID as input, which corresponds to the file the user wants to access. The method will request the file from the file handler, decipher it using the ciphering/deciphering module, and return the deciphered contents as a string.
 The decryptionKey variable will be used here to decipher the file contents, and can be passed into the file handler as needed.
Returns:
    - A string containing the contents of the specified file.
Parameters:
  - fileID: An integer representing the ID of the file to be accessed.

+ mapCipherKey(String keyFile)
+ decipher(String cipheredText):String

Explanation (mapCipherKey):
    - Void function to match ciphered and original characters in the hashmap
    - Take 1 argument which is the name of the file containing cipher key
    - no return
Explanation (decipher):
    - Using the hashmap to decipher the inputted String
    Return:
        - deciphered text
