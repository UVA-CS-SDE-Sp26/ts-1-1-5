Description:
You are responsible for implementing the ciphering feature. This feature should accept a ciphered string and return it deciphered.
The cipher will be stored in a file named key.txt, stored in a folder, ciphers, (in the same directory of the program, or in the
root of your project folder.) This file will contain two lines, the first line is the actual letter, the second line is the cipher match.
When the cipher is accessed, it must be validated. An example will be provided. Document this in cipher.txt.

key.txt format:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890
bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890a

Pseudocode:
key = read key.txt file in ciphers folder
cipherMap = Create a Dictionary/Map where {cipheredLine[i]: decipheredLine[i]}
decipheredText = ""
for character in cipheredText:
    if character exists in Map:
        decipheredText += cipherMap[character]
    ELSE:
        decipheredText += character
return decipheredText

Test:
Test for error in mapCipherKey:
    Given "abc.txt" (file that does not exist in ciphers folder), expects "FileNotFoundException"
    Given "empty_key.txt" (key file with no line or 1 line), expects "MissingLinesException"
    Given "Unequal_lines.txt" (key file with unequal line), expects "DifferentLengthException"
    Given "duplicate.txt" (key file with duplicate character in same line), expects "DuplicateCharacterException"
Test decipher function:
    Using the default key.txt file
        Test for one character:
            given "g" expected output is "f"
        Test for multiple characters:
            given "bcd" as input, expected output is "abc"
        Test for numbers:
            given "a123" as input, expected output is "0Z12"
        Test with space and full stop:
            given "Uif eph.", expected output is "The dog."
    Using the newkey.txt file (Shift 2 instead of 1):
        given "Ecv", expected "Cat"
