Plan for the design of the software that handles direct access to files

Team Memer B:
    -Receives request from C
    -Returns file content or file list depending on request type

Team Member C:
    -Connects command line to file handler
    -Handles requests from Member A and forwards it to Member B
    -Handles deciphered text file from Member B and forwards it to Member A

Team Member D:
    -Handles deciphering for requested files

UML:

FileHandler
-------------------------------
+returnAvailableFiles() : File[]
+returnAvailableFileNames() : String
+returnFileContents(int fileID, Cipher cipherHandler) : String
-------------------------------

returnAvailableFiles() is used to make the program compatible with fileID which is the index of the requested file
returnAvailableFileNames() returns the .cip file names
returnFileContents() returns the deciphered text

Testing:

test if correct files are returned
test if invalid fileID returns error
test if requested file is returned decrypted
