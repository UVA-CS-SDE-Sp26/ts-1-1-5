Plan for the design of the software that handles direct access to files

Team Memer B:
    -Receives request from C
    -Returns file or file list depending on request type

Team Member C:
    -Connects command line to file handler
    -Handles requests from Member A and forwards it to Member B
    -Handles deciphered text file from Member B and forwards it to Member A

Team Member D:
    -Handles deciphering for request files

Testing:

test if no args returns list of files
test if requested file is returned
test if requested file is returned decrypted
