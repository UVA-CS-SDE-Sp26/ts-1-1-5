TopSecret documentation starter file



Tasks (First week):
Discuss in your team how the system will work. Take notes!
Create a task list.
Draw a diagram to illustrate it. Don’t worry too much about doing the diagram ‘right’ at the moment, just make your own picture. You should be able to circle responsibilities for A, B, C and D. (D if the team has four members)
Define how these parts interconnect.
Connect to your team in GitHub, download the starter code for your project, and commit documentation and test designs.

Task (Final week):
Further design tests and create them. (NOTE each engineer has their own tests.)
Write code, run tests.
TA review - software must download and run a testing script
Team self-assessment. What will work better next time? Take notes.


System Design:

All code is run from the TopSecret class, which is the main entry point for the program.
